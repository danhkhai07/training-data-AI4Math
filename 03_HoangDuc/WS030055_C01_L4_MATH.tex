\section*{Problem}

\text{In a certain region, approximately $6\%$ of the city's population moves to the suburbs each year, and approximately $4\%$ of the suburban population moves into the city.}
\text{In 2020, the city had $10,000,000$ residents and the suburbs had $800,000$ residents.}

\text{Let $x_k$ be the city population and $y_k$ be the suburban population after $k$ years, and let $\mathbf{v}_k = \begin{pmatrix} x_k \\ y_k \end{pmatrix}$.}
\text{The initial state is $\mathbf{v}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 10,000,000 \\ 800,000 \end{pmatrix}$.}

\text{Set up the difference equation that describes this migration, $\mathbf{v}_{k+1} = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{v}_k$.} \\
\text{Then, estimate the city and suburban populations after two years (2022).}
