\section*{Problem}

\text{A mining company operates two mines. Each day of operation at Mine 1 yields ore containing 20 tons of copper and 550 kg of silver, while each day of operation at Mine 2 yields ore containing 30 tons of copper and 500 kg of silver.}
\text{Let $\mathbf{v}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 20 \\ 550 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{v}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 30 \\ 500 \end{pmatrix}$. Then $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ represent the "daily output" of Mine 1 and Mine 2, respectively.}

\subsection*{(a)}
\text{Give a physical interpretation for the vector $5\mathbf{v}_1$.}

\subsection*{(b)}
\text{Suppose the company operates Mine 1 for $x_1$ days and Mine 2 for $x_2$ days. Write a vector equation whose solution gives the number of days each mine should operate to produce 150 tons of copper and 2825 kg of silver.}

\subsection*{(c)}
\text{Solve the vector equation from part (b).}
